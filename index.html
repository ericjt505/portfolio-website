        <p>Eric J. Tolbert is currently in the Digital Innovation Online Program at Arkansas State University with a concentration on graphic communications. He has been in the program since the summer of 2019, and he hopes to receive his BS degree by God's will in 2021. Eric received his AS in Occupational Studies with a concentration in computer graphic design from Southeast College of Technology, Louisiana, and has since been renamed Remington College. He worked primarily as a graphic designer and production artist in print media while dabbling in digital media for some projects. It wasn't until his experience as a multimedia specialist that ignited his desire to learn more about the digital side of the design industry that led him back to school.</p>
